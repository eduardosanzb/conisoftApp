Conisoft 2016 
*****

## Introduction

This application has for purpose to manage the schedule of events.
Properly for the Conisoft 2016 that is a Natioanl Software event in Mexico.

So my University is hosting the event so lets make the app (easy one).

In this README we will be adding the plugins for the app, but first "let me take a selfie" no jk, first lets
talk about the app.

The app is made with Ionic framework as the front-end and we will use Firebase as the backend.
